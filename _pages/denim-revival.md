Investigate ways to re-design your old denim products (jeans,etc) to create a new unique product. You will then learn practical ways to decorate and construct a bag from the original deconstructed garment.

Materials and equipment will be supplied (you will need to bring your own denim product) and classes will run with the aim of completing a bag by the end of the course.
