Investigate ways to re-design your old denim products (jeans,etc) to create a unique bag. You will then learn to decorate and construct a new product from the original deconstructed garment.

Materials and equipment will be supplied (you will need to bring your own denim product) and classes will run with the aim of completing a new denim product by the end of the course.
