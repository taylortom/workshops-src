During the first session, investigate ways to re-design your old denim product (jeans, skirt, etc) to create a unique bag. You will then learn about the traditional ethnic dye resist technique of Adir√© Eleko which originates from Western Nigeria. Enjoy a short history of its origins and guidance on how to create a design for your own fabric. This will be digitally printed in preparation for week 2 when you will construct your new bag or skirt from the original deconstructed garment.

Materials and equipment will be supplied (you will need to bring your own denim product) and both classes will run from 10am until 3pm with the aim of completing a new denim product by the end of the 2nd session.
