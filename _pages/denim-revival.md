Investigate ways to re-design your old denim garments (jeans,etc) to create a new unique bag. You will then learn practical ways to decorate and construct the bag from your original deconstructed garment.

Materials and equipment will be supplied (you will need to bring your own denim product) and classes will run with the aim of completing a bag by the end of the course.
