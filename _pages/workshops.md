Our workshops offer the opportunity to try a range of textile techniques from surface decoration and embellishment through to the skills required to design and construct textile products & clothing. Class size and duration is planned appropriately according to the project being run, and small groups up to 8 people can be accommodated. 

Refreshments are included with all our workshops, and full-day classes will also have a midday break, so please bring a packed lunch.
