Workshops are organised by Liz Taylor who has over 35 years experience working with textiles. During this time, Liz has run her own textile surface design & print business and has taught art, design, textiles and fashion to students of all ages.

Liz believes the important thing for all students is to build confidence through experimentation with different techniques and media. This in turn will increase enjoyment and nurture creativity. 

Our aim is therefore to provide workshops which offer the opportunity to try a range of textile techniques in a friendly and relaxed environment.
