**Mola**

**Classes start from £22.50 per person for a 3 hour class**

A brief introduction to the history and origins of this traditional reverse appliqué technique from the San Blas Islands in Central America.  Create your own design then add hand embellishment before creating a unique outcome depending on the class selected.
Materials and equipment will be supplied and classes will run according to the chosen outcome, with the aim of completing cloth and product by the end of the session.
