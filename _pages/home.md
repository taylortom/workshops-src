The Stable House is situated in picturesque countryside in the village of Great Dalby near Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire.

Workshops are organised by Liz Taylor who has many years experience running her own textiles business and teaching design, textiles and fashion. Our aim is to offer the opportunity to try a range of textile art techniques in a friendly and relaxed environment, so come and enjoy a session of creative textiles in a pleasant country setting!
