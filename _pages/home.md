The Stable House is situated in picturesque Leicestershire countryside in the village of Great Dalby near Melton Mowbray.

Workshops are organised by Liz Taylor who has many years experience running her own textiles business and teaching Design, Textiles and Fashion to students of all ages.

Liz believes the most important thing for all students is to nurture enjoyment through creating, and aims to accomplish this by building confidence using different techniques and media.

Our workshops offer the opportunity to try a range of textile art techniques in a friendly and relaxed environment, so come and enjoy a session of creative textiles in a pleasant country setting!

[Get in touch](/contact) if you would like to sign up for one of our workshops, or would like to know more.

Looking forward to meeting you soon!
