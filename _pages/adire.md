Investigate the traditional ethnic dye resist technique of Adiré Eleko. 
Enjoy a short history of its origins and guidance on how to create your own fabric. You will then add hand embellishment to the cloth before creating a unique outcome depending on the class selected.
Materials and equipment will be supplied and classes will run according to the chosen outcome, with the aim of completing cloth and product by the end of the session.
