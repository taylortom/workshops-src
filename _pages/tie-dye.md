Learn about the well known dye resist technique of tie-dye. Enjoy a short history of its origins and guidance on how to create your own fabric. You will then scan and digitally print your design before learning to construct a cushion cover using your tie-dye fabric.

Materials and equipment will be supplied and the class will run from 10am until 4pm with the aim of completing a cushion cover by the end of the session. Cushions not supplied so you may wish to bring a cushion you have at home.
