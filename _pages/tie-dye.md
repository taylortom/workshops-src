**Tie-Dye**

**Classes start from Â£22.50 per person for a 3 hour session.**

Learn about the well known dye resist technique of tie-dye. Enjoy a short history of its origins and guidance on how to create your own fabric. You may wish to add hand embellishment before creating a unique outcome depending on the class selected.
Materials and equipment will be supplied and classes will run according to the chosen outcome, with the aim of completing cloth and product by the end of the session.
